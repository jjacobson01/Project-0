Part Two: Fixing the Bugs
-------------------------

Understanding the code

  1) Explain why this program uses the exclamation operator with the
      strcmp() function.
      strcomp compares the 2 strings in it's parameters.
      !strcomp() is use to return an integer 0 or a 1. 1 if both strings are equal or 0 if they are not equal. 
    

  2) Explain why the 'LENGTH' macro returns the length of an array.
     Would it work with a pointer to a dynamically allocated array? (Hint:
     understand sizeof).
      the 'LENGTH' macro is designed to find the length of an array in C language. the numerator sizeof(s), 
      will multiple the size of the array in bytes by length of the array. The Denominator finds the size of
      the first element of the array and multiplies it by the byte size. Dividing the two together gives you
      the length of the array.

Bug hunting

  3) Explain and fix the logical flow bug within the switch statement.
     (What happens when the -h option is used?)
      The switch statement will either display the print from case 'h' or default. If you 
      input h it will display both case 'h' and default because there is no 'break' in the case 'h'.
      applying the break code will fix and will only display what is in case 'h'.


  4) Explain and fix the argument parsing error. (Why is entrycount never
     zero?)
      entryCount will never be zero because it increments, even if you don't provide an argument.
      It happens before getting to flag. adding 1 increment of the variable argv before starting the
      the loop will fix this issue.

  5) Fix print_result() to print results correctly and in the same order
      as the words were specified on the command line.  Explain your solution.
      Implementing the variable i and initilizing it to 0 and using it to cycle through the array
      fixed it so that it would print the words correctly.
